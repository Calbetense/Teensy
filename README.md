# Teensy
Teensy utils. Kind of a library to use it.

The idea for this project is to update it every time I archieve something new about a module from the datasheet. That's how I want to make a handy library to consult when I have to use something similar.

I use the Arduino workbench, but I'm trying to code only with registers. It's little confuse, but I try to solve it with enough comments. 

I'm not certainly sure about how I'm going to organice it, but it'll be somehow. Firstly I think it will be in four different folders:

# 1:
    main.h: links everything
# 2: 
    common.h: methods declarations and macros
# 3:
    common.c: methods implementation
# 4: 
    main.h: examples of use and shows how to use interrupts and clearing each flag
    
I'm not sure if anyone is going to end up here. If you does, first: sorry for my english, I'm not native. Second: Hope it helps. Luck.
